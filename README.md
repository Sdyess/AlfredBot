# AlfredBot

AlfredBot is a Discord Bot written in the Go language. The bot currently serves as a moderator of a CompSci discord chat for a university. If you would like to use AlfredBot for your own servers, you can replace the token and database info in his files. The bot will be available to be added to your servers shortly, as long as I'm still hosting it.

If you insist on hosting your own version of AlfredBot, you'll need some dependancies to use him properly.
```
go get github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo
go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
```

You will also need 
`https://github.com/koyachi/go-nude`
which is not available through go get.


Please consider that AlfredBot only has basic abilities and is still a huge work in progress. You can view the milestones for the project to view upcoming features for the program. Documentation will be added throughly when Alfred reaches a halfway point. If you would like to contribute to AlfredBot, feel free to make a pull request at any time.
