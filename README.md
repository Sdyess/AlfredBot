AlfredBot is a Discord bot written in Go.

The intention of this bot is to serve as a all-in-one for a streamer with features that streamers are currently using multiple bots to piece together to get what they're looking for.

Current plan is to piece all of the features together and then look at how everything works out performance wise. Going from there, adjustments can be made in how everything is actually pieced together.

All parts are written in small modules, so in the case that the final version of this is too much for the single application to handle, parts can be moved into microservices or a different architecture in order to fulfill it's needs.
